# SICP Exercise 1.8

## Exercise

Newton's method for cube roots is based on the fact that if `y` is an approximation to the cube root of `x`, then a better approximation is given by the value:

x/y2 + 2y / 3

Use this formula to implement a cube-root procedure analogous to the square root-procedure.

## Solution
